# Integrate-2015-Boardroom
AMX System demonstrating a boardroom at Integrate 2015 in Melbourne.

This system integrates with Google Calendar to schedule meetings, the room is unable to be used until a valid appointment is scheduled via the calendar/RMS Scheduling System. The user then uses their NFC Card to activate the system using the boardroom touchpanel.

##RMS Files are omitted from this repo in accordance with licensing and will need to be manually added to make the system function!!
